Double machine epsilon = 2,22044604925031E-16

Comparison Value (double) = 2,22044604925031E-16

Float machine epsilon = 1,192093E-07

Comparison value (float) = 1,19209289550781E-07

a==b ? False this result is due to floating point arithmetic, a=1+tiny=1, and when tiny is added again it is rounded down again, b=1+epsiloilonn, since tiny+tiny is representable as epsilon

a>1 ? False this result is due to arithmetic again, a is equal to exactly 1 here

b>1 ? True this result is due to floating point arithmetic, here b=1+epsilon

d1=7,999999999999999e-001
d2=8,000000000000000e-001
d1==d2 ? => False
d1==d2 ? => True
